# Countries parser
Parses country data from various sources for database and CDN creation.

Uses the following sources for data:

- https://github.com/countries/countries - main data source
- https://github.com/hampusborgos/country-flags - flag images
- https://www.worldatlas.com/countries - for non-ISO country name

Currently only contains currency codes, but currency symbols could potentially be retrieved from https://github.com/RubyMoney/money (although this may almost be too comprehensive).
